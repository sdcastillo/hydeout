These are the new technologies that actuaries are most excited about.

This is from more than 200 articles published by the SOA's [Predictive Analytics & Futurism Section](https://www.soa.org/sections/pred-analytics-futurism/pred-analytics-futurism-landing/), a research newsletter written by actuaries.   

There is a lot of confusion about what "AI", "Machine Learning", or "Predictive Analytics" actually represent.   After sitting through dozens of presentations, several conferences, and reading up on the literature, I have discovered the following rule of thumb.

- If it's in a CEO's PowerPoint than it's AI;
- If it’s in a data scientist’s PowerPoint then it’s machine learning (or machine intelligence);
- If it’s in an actuary’s PowerPoint then it’s predictive analytics.

On a more serious note, what I found most interesting about binge-reading most of these articles is that many of these ideas have been around for years.  Although AI is now a hot topic, Deep Learning first appeared in 2014.  I have still not met a real-life actuary who uses deep learning.  Many of the topics which are less "trendy" I found to be very useful, such as behavioral economics, complexity theory, and game theory.  These ideas are also applicable to everyday decision making.  For example, by reading ("Why Smart People Make Big Money Mistakes")[https://www.amazon.com/Smart-People-Money-Mistakes-Correct/dp/0684859386], a book about behavioral economics, I found that I am prone to many irrational purchasing and investment decisions.
