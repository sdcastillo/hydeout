Deep learning can use data that no other algorithms can.  Video, audio, text, real-time sensor data such as electronic health records can now be used in models to predict future events.

A few of the applications are:

**Video**
- Gathering medical data from telehealth recordings to learn from doctor-patient interactions.  In addition to medical information such as symptoms and diagnosis, AI can read the stress level of the patient from their tone of voice, mental alertness from the speed at which they answer questions, and emotional well-being from facial expressions.  Google is already using deep learning to [remotely treat diabetes patients](https://intouchhealth.com/how-ai-augments-telehealth/).
- Using vehicle video and sensor data to assess risk in auto insurance.  Drivers that exhibit riskier behavior can be identified *before* they get into accidents, and safe drivers can be rewarded.  By 2030-2035, when self-driving cars are commonplace, vehicles will collect [terabytes of data per year](https://www.tuxera.com/blog/autonomous-cars-300-tb-of-data-per-year/).
- Installing [surveillance cameras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_for_video_surveillance) around buildings to measure foot traffic, fire and vandalism risk, customer engagement, and other factors.  For example, if there are more people walking in and out of the store, it is more likely that a person will fall, injure themselves, and sue the retailer. 
- Facial recognition cameras that record time and location of individuals.  There are many potential use cases for this.  [China](https://time.com/collection/davos-2019/5502592/china-social-credit-score/) already has a "social credit score" and [uses cameras to track individuals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrFwIShaSd8).  The official guidelines for this score are "To allow the trustworthy to roam everywhere under heaven, while making it hard for the discredited to take a single step".  In the U.S., we are already using financial credit data for life insurance underwriting as a predictor of mortality.  If a similar social credit system were in use today, it would likely be even more predictive of mortality.

**Audio/Text**
- In hospitals and medical offices, [patient-doctor conversations](https://bdtechtalks.com/2019/08/27/deep-medicine-ai-doctor-patient-relationship/) can be recorded to automate the medical billing procedure.  Medical codes will become more granular and doctors can spend less time typing on keyboards and more time with the patient, making these conversations more predictive of future health outcomes.  Doctor's notes today suffer from many inconsistencies due in part to how little time doctors spend writing them.  Once better audio-to-text systems are available, this will no longer be an issue.
- Phone recordings from customers can be translated into text and used to assess the customers mood, stress level, or even if they are a smoker by the sound of their voice.  Filing claims will become less expensive as AI staff can take over the claims processing, from answering calls from humans to sending bills by email.  Deductibles and copays, which are partially used to reduce the number of low-cost claims that are filed due to administrative expenses, or LAE, will become less common.  The startup Lemonade already [uses chatbots for claims processing](https://stories.lemonade.com/lemonade-sets-new-world-record-706ef8674110).

**Sensor Technology**
- The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to sensors that collect data on things such as medical devices, fit bits, home security systems, cars, and mobile devices.  [McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/digital-ecosystems-for-insurers-opportunities-through-the-internet-of-things) has a report on how the IoT will impact the insurance world in many other examples.
- Using aerial drones for monitoring construction sites for building hazards or [monitoring crops for predicting future yields](https://www.aerobotics.com/?identifier=default-get-in-touch-button).
- Electronic Health Records (EHR) will be ubiquitous in 3-5 years.  This data is in an unstructured format that only AI/ML algorithms are capable of dealing with.
- Insurance companies can provide discounts to homeowners that install security systems.  They can then collect this data to learn more about their customers and improve underwriting decisions.
- Assisted living facilities will use devices to improve the quality of care in the aging population.  Insurance companies can provide lower premiums in exchange for participating.
