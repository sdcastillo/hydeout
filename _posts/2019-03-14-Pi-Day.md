As a math major at UMass Amherst, I once asked a professor a question based on an exercise buried at the end of a calculus textbook.  

What happens if you add together 1 + 1/4 + 1/9 + 1/16 + 1/25 â€¦ forever?

This turns out to be a famous problem, known as the Basel problem.

Instead of brushing this question aside, he put aside office hours to write up a detailed, three-page explanation.  The fact that a professor would go to such lengths to help a single student was humbling.  I was inspired to continuing studying math.
And the answer?  

It turns out to be pi^2/6.

Happy Pi day.
