The only useful model is the one which is in production, but creating a model on your laptop is much easier than putting it into a 
production-ready capacity.  In the real world, data is big, messy, and often in the cloud or unstructured format.  Simply cleaning the data
is a task in itself.  Then making predictions on top of this, using a model which requires precise inputs, and transporting your model to a
scaleable environment is a different challenge altogether.

Fortunately, some models are simple enough that they do not require a re-coding to be useful.  A linear model is one example.  In this tutorial, you will learn how to quickly convert a linear model from R into an Excel spreadsheet.
