As I write this, I am feeling guilty because I am falling behind on my study schedule for the next actuarial exam, LTAM.  But then I ask myself, "what is the better investment of my time, researching AI or studying math from 40 years ago"?

## Myth #1: AI is only a recent trend.

AI and Machine Learning are now buzzwords in the actuarial industry, but these methods have been in the background for years.  For those of us who have recently entered the industry, it feels as though this change is more recent, that actuaries are “behind the times”, and that new technologies are just now beginning to reshape the insurance world.

I just attended a conference of over 200 actuaries who where going through slide deck after slide deck of how GANs, CNNs, GBMs, and NLP algorithms.  Actuaries in health talked about using ML to mine EHR records.  Actuaries in life insurance are using ML to scan millions of records of prescription, medical, and credit data.  Even the pension actuaries have caught on.

Excited by all of this, I began reading through old publications.  To my surprise, I found that ML and Deep Learning have been in the industry for years.  Deep Learning first appeared in an actuarial newsletter in 2014.  Machine Learning, which has gone by different names such as “forecasting” and “predictive modeling” has been around since 2012.

**TL;DR: People have been saying 'this is all hype' since 2014, but the AI paradigm shift has only been growing since then.**

## Myth #2: AI is only going to have minimal impact, like GLMs did in the 1990s and ARIMA models in Quant Finance in the 1970s

## Myth #3: Actuaries can sit back and wait for the change to stabilize before taking action



AI is able to make use of data sources that no other algorithm can.
