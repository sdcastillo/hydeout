Hi, I'm Sam Castillo.  

When I born in Massachusetts in 1994.  In 1997, I attended Mrs. Curtis Daycare where I studied blocks and matchbox cars.  After great success, I continued my education in first grade through an internship designing Lego spaceships.  At the mature age of 7, I won a scholarship to study the work of Bill Waterson by reading Calvin and Hobbes.  That next year, in 2001, I was given a $50 research grant to conduct ethnographic research on G.I. Joe.  

In 2017 I completed a B.S. in Math from the University of Massachusetts Amherst with the plan to study actuarial science.  After discovering that the SOA-approved TI-XS Multiview Calculator and the BA-II-Plus do not produce as pretty graphs as ggplot2, I decided to continue taking actuarial exams but to focus also on data science. In 2019 I began working as a predictive modeler at Milliman IntelliScript. 

This blog is to keep track of actuarial, data science, and music side projects.
