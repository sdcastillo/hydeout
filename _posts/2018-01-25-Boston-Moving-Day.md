The Boston Globe estimated that two-thirds of the city's 165,000 properties change hands every year.  As thousands of students move in and out of the city, what does your neighborhood look like on September 1st?  I wanted to find out, so I downloaded the data from the city of boston ([Analyze Boston](https://data.boston.gov/)) and created this [Tableau Web App] (https://public.tableau.com/profile/samuel.castillo#!/vizhome/TheChaosofSept_1MovingDayinBoston/BostonMovingTruckPermits).

Each dot on the map represents a moving permit issued by the City of Boston between 2012 and 2017.
