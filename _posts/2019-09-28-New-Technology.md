These are the new technologies that actuaries are most excited about.

This is from more than 200 articles published by the SOA's Predictive Analytics Section, a research newsletter written by actuaries.  https://www.soa.org/sections/pred-analytics-futurism/pred-analytics-futurism-landing/ 

Although AI is now a hot topic, this has been in the background for years.  Deep Learning first appeared in 2014, although it is still not commonly used by actuaries.

The term "predictive analytics” is just a marketing term.  The easiest way to distinguish machine learning from predictive analytics is with this rule: If it’s in a data scientist’s PowerPoint then it’s ML; if it’s in an actuary’s PowerPoint then it’s predictive analytics.
