Hi, I'm Sam Castillo.  I am currently studying to work as an actuary.  Previously I have been with Blue Cross Blue Shield and Milliman after graduating from UMass Amherst.  Volunteer work has been with [CoachingActuaries](coachingactuaries.com) and [Esperanza Soaps](http://www.esperanza-soaps.com/soapmade/).  

This blog is to keep track of actuarial and data science side projects.

I do not pretend to be an expert.  If you spot a mistake, please leave a comment so that it can be fixed.
