As I write this, I am feeling guilty because I am falling behind on my study schedule for the next actuarial exam, LTAM.  But then I ask myself, "what is the better investment of my time, researching AI or studying math from 40 years ago"?

## Myth #1: AI is only a recent trend.

AI and Machine Learning are now buzzwords in the actuarial industry, but these methods have been in the background for years.  For those of us who have recently entered the industry, it feels as though this change is more recent, that actuaries are “behind the times”, and that new technologies are just now beginning to reshape the insurance world.

I just attended a conference of over 200 actuaries who where going through slide deck after slide deck of how GANs, CNNs, GBMs, and NLP algorithms.  Actuaries in health talked about using ML to mine EHR records.  Actuaries in life insurance are using ML to scan millions of records of prescription, medical, and credit data.  Even the pension actuaries have caught on.

Excited by all of this, I began reading through old publications.  To my surprise, I found that ML and Deep Learning have been in the industry for years.  Deep Learning first appeared in an actuarial newsletter in 2014.  Machine Learning, which has gone by different names such as “forecasting” and “predictive modeling” has been around since 2012.

## Myth #2: AI is only going to have minimal impact, like GLMs did in the 1990s and ARIMA models in Quant Finance in the 1970s

Deep learning has the ability to learn in ways that no other algorithm can.

## Myth #3: Actuaries can sit back and wait for the change to stabilize before taking action

Actuaries need to "review" or "sign off" on the accuracy of any method which they use.  This requires a degree of understanding of the technology.  There are two barriors that prevent the actuary from being able to verify deep-learning based results:

1. Actuaries do not have the programming skills to deal with the increasing complexity of the software.  
2. Data sources are now images, videos, and audio, none of which the actuary is trained on dealing with.

The surgical profession has seen a similar trend.  Traditionally, surgeons would be solely responsible.  From the moment that a patient was put on the operating table to the post-op discussion with the patient's family, the surgeon was the boss.  They new how every tool worked.  As medical technology as advanced, we know need anesthesiologists, radiologists, pathologist, and nurses to step up and contribute.  **Surgery used to be a solo act where the surgeon was the virtuoso; today, surgery is a team sport.**

Today we have data scientists, data engineers, machine learning engineers, and software developers all working in the same room as actuaries.  The actuary is no longer going to be the boss.  Actuarial science is becoming a team sport.
