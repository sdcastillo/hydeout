There is a lot of hype today around AI in the actuarial industry.  Here are a few of the common misconceptions.

## Myth #1: AI is only a recent trend.

AI and Machine Learning are now buzzwords in the actuarial industry, but these methods have been in the background for years.  For those of us who have recently entered the industry, it feels as though this change is more recent, that actuaries are “behind the times”, and that new technologies are just now beginning to reshape the insurance world.

Many discussions at the 2019 Predictive Analytics Symposium talked about AI.  Actuaries in health talked about using ML to mine EHR records.  Actuaries in life insurance are using ML to scan millions of records of prescription, medical, and credit data.  

Excited by all of this, I began reading through old publications.  Deep Learning first appeared in an actuarial newsletter in 2014.  Machine Learning, which has gone by different names such as “forecasting” and “predictive modeling” has been around since 2012.

## Myth #2: AI is mostly hype, and is just another tool that the actuary will learn to use

Deep learning has the ability to learn in ways that no other algorithm can.  Video, audio, text, and real-time sensor data such as electronic health records, and other non-traditional data sources can now be used in models.  Here are a few applications

**Video**
- Using photos and automous vehicle video and sensor data to assess the damage to auto insurance.  Drivers that exhibit riskier behavior can be identified *before* they get into accidents, and safe drivers can be rewarded.  
- Cameras in front of retail stores can record customer traffic patterns to be used for predicting general liability claims.  For example, if there are more people walking in and out of the store, it is more likely that a person will fall, injure themselves, and sue the retailer.
- Facial recognition cameras can record when and where people go.  There are many potential use cases for this.  (China)[https://time.com/collection/davos-2019/5502592/china-social-credit-score/] already has a "social credit score" and uses cameras to track individuals.  The official guidelines for this score are "To allow the trustworthy to roam everywhere under heaven, while making it hard for the discredited to take a single step".  In the U.S., we are already using financial credit data for life insurance underwriting as a predictor of mortality.  If a similar social credit system were in use today, it would likely be even more predictive of mortality.

**Audio**
- Patient-doctor conversations can be recorded to automate the medical billing procedure.  ICD10 codes will become more granular and doctors can spend less time typing out codes and more time with the patient, making these conversations more predictive of future health outcomes.
- Phone recordings from customers can be translated into text and used as inputs for policy lapse models.  



2.  The job of the insurance underwriter will disappear as automated underwriting takes over.  This is already in the early phases as insurance companies are using pharmaceutical, medical, and credit data.  China collects data on all citizens using cameras and creates a ["Social Credit Score"](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/08/business/china-surveillance-technology.html).  Just imagine how accurate we could estimate health premiums if we knew where you lived, what your commute was like, what you ate for breakfast, how often you exercised, if you smoked or did drugs, and how happy you were based on your facial expression.  EHR data will make blood tests, BMI, blood pressure, weight, and other medical data available to insurance companies.  The days when past claims are used as the only predictor of future claims will be over as new data sources combined with deep learning take over.

## Myth #3: Actuaries can sit back and wait for the change to stabilize before taking action

AI was recently added to China's [high-school curriculumn.](https://www.abacusnews.com/digital-life/china-brings-ai-high-school-curriculum/article/2144442).  There are now high-schoolers who now more about AI than actuaries.  With this type of knowledge disruption, those who do not learn new skills will be left behind.

Textbooks are out of date by the time that they are printed.  

- A researcher has an idea while in a Phd program.  
- They then publish the result after 5 years
- This paper turns into a textbook into another 2 years
- The topic is added to the SOA's syllabus after another year
- An actuary learns the topic and passes the exam in another year.

**The total travel time is 9 years!**

This prevents the actuary from being able to do their job effectively.  Actuaries need to "review" or "sign off" on the accuracy of any method which they use.  This requires a degree of understanding of the technology.  There are two barriors that prevent the actuary from being able to verify deep-learning based results:

1. Actuaries do not have the programming skills to deal with the increasing complexity of the software.  
2. Data sources are now images, videos, and audio, none of which the actuary is trained on dealing with.

The surgical profession has seen a similar trend.  Traditionally, surgeons would be solely responsible.  From the moment that a patient was put on the operating table to the post-op discussion with the patient's family, the surgeon was the boss.  They led the way with a scalpel as the actuary leads the way with a spreadsheet.  As medical technology as advanced, we know need anesthesiologists, radiologists, pathologist, and nurses to step up and contribute.  **Surgery used to be a solo act where the surgeon was the virtuoso; today, surgery is a team sport because medical technology has become too complex for one person to learn.**

Today we have data scientists, data engineers, machine learning engineers, and software developers all working in the same room as actuaries.  The actuary is no longer going to be the boss.  Actuarial science is becoming a team sport.
