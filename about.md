I have internship experience in actuarial and data science roles, helping business make smart decisions based on data. I have worked with consulting teams, health insurance teams, website owners, and a non-profit start-up. My responsibilities have been to leverage the latest tools, paired with domain-specific knowledge, to lower costs and plan for the future.

In May 2017 I graduated from the University of Massachusetts Amherst with a Bachelors in Math, where I concentrated in applied statistics, was an active member in the student club UGRiD (Undergraduates Interested in Data), and coached math and finance courses as a peer tutor. So far, I have completed exams P, FM, and MFE.

I'm always looking to meet new people, build new relationships, and find opportunities to learn and apply new skills. Please reach out to me or check out on-going projects below.
