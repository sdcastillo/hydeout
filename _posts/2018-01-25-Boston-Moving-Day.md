The Boston Globe estimated that two-thirds of the city's 165,000 properties change hands every year.  As thousands of students move in and out of the city, what does the landscape look like on September 1st?  I wanted to find out, so I downloaded the data from the city of boston from [Analyze Boston](https://data.boston.gov/) and created this [Tableau Web App](https://public.tableau.com/profile/samuel.castillo#!/vizhome/TheChaosofSept_1MovingDayinBoston/BostonMovingTruckPermits) .  

This data tracks individual moving van permits from the city, where a mover has paid a fee in order advance.  A moving permit is not required by the city, but insures that the owner will not receive parking tickets and will be garanteed a parking spot.  Each dot on the map represents a moving permit issued by the City of Boston between 2012 and 2017.

If you ask a local, they would tell you that the reason for number of movers is due to college students moving in for the new academic year, combined with the fact that many annual leases begin on September 1st.  

So which areas are the impacted most?  Here are a few highlights.
