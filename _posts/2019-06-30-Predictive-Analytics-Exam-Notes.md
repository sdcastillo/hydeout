Predictive analytics is about using statistical learning to improve a business outcome.  In the contect of insurance, this usually involves predicting future financial risks.

This was a 5-hour and 15 minute exam where candicates had only access to Rstudio, Excel, and Word.  The task was to start with a data set, 
clean and transform it, fit a model, and write a 10-page report which explained every step to both a technical and non-technical audience.  
These are my notes before the June 2019 version of the exam.  I hope that they are helpful.
