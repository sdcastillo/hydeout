Hi, I'm Sam Castillo.  I have started my career as an actuarial analyts and use this blog to keep track of interesting projects, helpful advice, and anything else that catches my attention.  My educational background is a B.S. in math from the University of Massachusetts Amherst, actuarial exams P, FM, and MFE, and internship experience in P&C and health insurance.

I'm always looking to meet new people, build new relationships, and find opportunities to learn and apply new skills. Please reach out to me or check out projects on the blog.
