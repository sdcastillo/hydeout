A few months ago, I sat on the first conference call with 43 other actuaries from around the U.S. applications of machine learning in insurance.  The Casualty Actuarial Society (CAS) had formed a working party to research this area, and the turnout has been bigger than anyone has expected.  We have since divided into two sub-groups to focus on 1) producing a worked-example of using ML, which is where I am, and 2) researching how to encorporate ML while following regulatory limitations.

The life-side of actuarial science, the SOA, also is highly active in this area, and they even have a monthly newsletter about predictive analytics which I have subscribed to [See the SOA's Section of Predictive Analytics and Futurism](https://www.google.com/search?q=soa+predictive+anlaytics+and+futurism&rlz=1C1GGRV_enUS786US786&oq=soa+predictive+anlaytics+and+futurism&aqs=chrome..69i57j0.5077j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)

This is a personal effort to gain familiarity with building models for pricing insurance products.  Read the [rough draft of my analysis here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sdcastillo/ML-for-Insurance-Ratemaking/blob/master/comparing_machine_learning_models_for_insurance_ratemaking.pdf)
